# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing various customer attributes, such as age, tenure, usage frequency, and payment behavior. Understanding customer churn helps companies reduce revenue loss by improving customer retention strategies.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Utilizes clustering algorithms (like KMeans) to segment customers into different groups based on their behavior.
- **Churn Prediction**: Insights into customer behaviors that indicate a higher risk of churn.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information with the following key features:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Tenure`: The duration (in months) the customer has been subscribed to the service.
- `Usage Frequency`: How often the customer uses the service.
- `Support Calls`: Number of calls the customer made to customer support.
- `Payment Delay`: Instances of payment delays by the customer.
- `Subscription Type`: The subscription plan (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
- `Contract Length`: The length of the customer's contract (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).
- `Total Spend`: Total amount spent by the customer.
- `Last Interaction`: The last recorded interaction with the customer.
- `Churn`: Indicates if the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
